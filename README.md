- **AI Integration**: Simple OpenAI-based chatbot

## 📋 Problem Statement

In the digital age, our identities are fragmented across multiple platforms, with data stored in centralized databases vulnerable to breaches and misuse. Users lack control over their personal information and must repeatedly verify their identity across different services.

SecureID addresses these challenges by:
1. Giving users full ownership of their digital identity
2. Enabling selective disclosure of information
3. Providing a secure, tamper-proof system for identity verification
4. Eliminating the need for repeated identity verification processes

## 🔍 Solution

SecureID is a decentralized identity platform that enables users to:

1. **Create a blockchain-based identity** that they fully own and control
2. **Add verifiable credentials** like education certificates, licenses, or ID documents
3. **Selectively share identity information** with third parties
4. **Verify the authenticity** of credentials without revealing sensitive information

## 🏗️ Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/800x500/4338CA/FFFFFF?text=SecureID+Architecture)

The system consists of three main components:
1. **Smart Contracts**: Handle identity creation, credential management, and verification
2. **Frontend Interface**: User-friendly interface for managing digital identity
3. **AI Assistant**: Guides users through the identity management process
